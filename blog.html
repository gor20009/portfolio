            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>My wife and I love to spend our time being outdoors. We love everything from hiking and fishing in the mountains to traveling around big cities to watch our favorite sports teams. Though life can get busy at times, it is always important to us that we find time to get outside and enjoy our Heavenly Fatherâ€™s creation. Part of the enjoyment in finding hobbies we both enjoy is planning them together. There is a joint excitement in preparing throughout the week to set off on a new adventure. Through our hobbies we are able to escape the worries of everyday life and it is this reason that I hope to share these new hobbies and adventures so you can go out and try them yourselves.</p>

            <h3>Traveling</h3>
            <p>It has always been exciting to visit different parts of the world and experience different cultures. Before my wife and I got married, we both shared the same ambition to travel. While we have been in school, we have had the opportunity to visit amazing places around North America. Together we have traveled to the coast of California, the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, different parts of Mexico, the windy city in Illinois, and everything in between. We have begun saving our money for trips to Europe and South America and hope to share more about those adventures when we return.</p>
