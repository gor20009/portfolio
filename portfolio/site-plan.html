        Introduction
      </p>
      <p>
        My name is Jaxon Gordon and I am from the small town of Kamas, Utah. I am a current student at Brigham Young University-Idaho. I will be graduating with a degree in accounting by the end of this year. I got married to my amazing wife Faith in 2023. I graduated high school from South Summit High and served an LDS mission in Guatemala, Retalhuleu. Across my site, I hope to share the contents of my web pages with close friends and family. My pages are built like a social media platform where I can share what happens in my life year to year. My hope is that my webpage will be something that my future children and grandchildren can open and look at as I get older. Though I am gearing this site for close family and friends, I hope it is used for all those who want to learn more about me and what I enjoy doing.

      <p>
        Personal Blog & Picture Book
      </p>
      <p>
        On my homepage, there will be a link that will allow you to access my personal blog that is updated with short paragraphs of some favorite vacations and big life events that happen year to year. I will also be posting short paragraphs about my wife and I’s hobbies and adventures. There will also be another link that allows you to access a picture book of all the different pictures I enjoy taking during my travels. Unlike the blog, the picture book will have one small paragraph explaining the page’s purpose. All photos and work across all the pages I make will be my own.

        Hobbies
      </p>
      <p>
        My wife and I love to spend our time being outdoors. We love everything from hiking and fishing in the mountains to traveling around big cities to watch our favorite sports teams. Though life can get busy at times, it is always important to us that we find time to get outside and enjoy our Heavenly Father’s creation. Part of the enjoyment in finding hobbies we both enjoy is planning them together. There is a joint excitement in preparing throughout the week to set off on a new adventure. Through our hobbies we are able to escape the worries of everyday life and it is this reason that I hope to share these new hobbies and adventures so you can go out and try them yourselves. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Traveling
      </p>
      <p>
        It has always been exciting to visit different parts of the world and experience different cultures. Before my wife and I got married, we both shared the same ambition to travel. While we have been in school, we have had the opportunity to visit amazing places around North America. Together we have traveled to the coast of California, the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, different parts of Mexico, the windy city in Illinois, and everything in between. We have begun saving our money for trips to Europe and South America and hope to share more about those adventures when we return.

        Photography
      </p>
      <p>
        Though I am no professional in photography, I love taking pictures during my travels. For me, a picture can recall memories that have been forgotten better than words on a page. When sharing experiences with others, pictures have a way of sharing that experience in greater detail. I take a great deal of pictures on every trip I go on by myself, with my wife, or with family. For this reason, I hope to dedicate one of my pages to display some of my best pictures from every trip. In my opinion, there is no better way to share who I am and what I enjoy doing.
