            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>My name is Jaxon Gordon and I am from the small town of Kamas, Utah. I am a current student at Brigham Young University-Idaho. I will be graduating with a degree in accounting by the end of this year. I got married to my amazing wife Faith in 2023. I graduated high school from South Summit High and served an LDS mission in Guatemala, Retalhuleu. Across my site, I hope to share the contents of my web pages with close friends and family. My pages are built like a social media platform where I can share what happens in my life year to year. My hope is that my webpage will be something that my future children and grandchildren can open and look at as I get older. Though I am gearing this site for close family and friends, I hope it is used for all those who want to learn more about me and what I enjoy doing.</p>

            <h3>Personal Blog & Picture Book</h3>
            <p>On my homepage, there will be a link that will allow you to access my personal blog that is updated with short paragraphs of some favorite vacations and big life events that happen year to year. I will also be posting short paragraphs about my wife and I’s hobbies and adventures. There will also be another link that allows you to access a picture book of all the different pictures I enjoy taking during my travels. Unlike the blog, the picture book will have one small paragraph explaining the page’s purpose. All photos and work across all the pages I make will be my own.</p>
